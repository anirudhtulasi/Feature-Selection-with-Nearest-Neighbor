# Nearest Neighbor
Define function nearest_neighbor with parameters (dataset, test_instance)
    For each item in dataset:
        Compute distance between current item and test_instance (exclude class labels when calculating distance)
    EndFor
    Return class label of the item with smallest distance
EndFunction

# Forward Selection
Define function forward_selection with parameter (dataset)
    Let selected_features be an empty list
    While there is an improvement in accuracy:
        For each feature not in selected_features:
            Temporarily add feature to selected_features
            Evaluate accuracy of nearest_neighbor using selected_features
            If accuracy improves:
                Permanently add feature to selected_features
        EndFor
    EndWhile
    Return selected_features
EndFunction

# Backward Elimination
Define function backward_elimination with parameter (dataset)
    Let selected_features be a list containing all features
    While there is an improvement in accuracy:
        For each feature in selected_features:
            Temporarily remove feature from selected_features
            Evaluate accuracy of nearest_neighbor using selected_features
            If accuracy improves:
                Permanently remove feature from selected_features
        EndFor
    EndWhile
    Return selected_features
EndFunction
